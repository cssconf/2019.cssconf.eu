Our [Scholarship programme](/scholarships/) is aimed at directly supporting
folks from underrepresented groups in tech by giving them the means to attend
our conferences. Last year, [we were able to give out 125
tickets](https://2018.jsconf.eu/news/scholarships-awarded/) for people from
around the world — our largest turnout ever and one of the largest scholarship
programmes of any non-profit tech conference to that date!

Unfortunately, things are looking a lot less exciting this year. The reasons
for this are twofold: We are not selling nearly enough Diversity Support
Tickets, which directly benefit our Scholarship Programme, and we are currently
lacking Diversity Sponsors, who contribute financially to our Scholarship
budget. Last year, our sponsor
[Mercedes-Benz.io](https://2018.jsconf.eu/news/mercedes-benz-supports-scholarship-program/)
generously donated funds to enable 30 additional ticket scholarships.

Unfortunately, all of this has led us to have to suspend the scholarship
process for two weeks because we do not have the necessary budget. We first
aimed for sending out responses, on March 24, but had to postpone to March 29,
and then April 5. We hope to provide feedback as soon as we can recalculate our
budget and make the necessary adjustments.

In order to help us be able to award more scholarships, you can support us in
the following ways:

## What you could do as a person:

- Buy a [Diversity Support Ticket](https://ti.to/cssconfeu/cssconfeu-2019/)
(also available for [JSConf EU](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-x-2019))! This
is by far the easiest way, and you get a conference ticket in the process.
- [Directly
support](https://2019.cssconf.eu/news/direct-support-for-our-scholarship-program/)
our Scholarship budget.

## What your employer may be able to do:

Does your company have a diversity hiring program or something similar? Could
you get us in touch with the folks responsible for investing those budgets? We
are happy to figure out any custom Diversity Sponsorship packages that suit
your needs. Contact us at [contact@cssconf.eu](mailto:contact@cssconf.eu) for
more information.

Our Scholarship program is an integral part of our conference, and we wholly
believe that by growing it, we’re growing our conference as a whole. Thank you
for making a contribution towards helping us achieve that goal!

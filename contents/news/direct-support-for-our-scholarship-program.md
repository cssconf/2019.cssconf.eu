The [CSSconf EU scholarship program](https://2019.cssconf.eu/scholarships/) has
supported folks from underrepresented groups to be able to attend our event
since 2015. For the 2018 event we were able to [significantly scale up the
program](https://2018.jsconf.eu/news/scholarships-awarded/) to and award over
125 tickets (CSSconf EU + JSconf EU) in addition to travel grants for people
from all over the world. We‚Äôd love to do even better in 2019 and grant an even
bigger group of people access to the knowledge and networking opportunities of
our event‚Äìwhich has proven to often have a profound impact on their careers.

The program is supported through 3 mechanisms

1. You can [purchase a special ticket](https://ti.to/cssconfeu/cssconfeu-2019/)
that gives a portion of the price to the scholarship program. This is the right
option if you‚Äôd like to attend the conference yourself and support the program.
2. Our sponsorship packets contain a grant to the scholarship program.
3. üö®**And NEW: You can now [support the program
directly](https://ti.to/cssconfeu/cssconfeu-2019/with/xmt7jc66z2k).** 
We added the option to directly support the program through popular demand. In
particular, we‚Äôd love to thank [Mike West](https://twitter.com/mikewest) and
[Whitney Williams](https://twitter.com/whitneyhacks) who independently asked us
to be allowed to make a contribution and together raised 3000 Euros for the
program ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

To make a contribution of any amount, please [go to this
link](https://ti.to/cssconfeu/cssconfeu-2019/with/xmt7jc66z2k) and select how
much you‚Äôd like to donate. Please note, that while the conference is a
not-for-profit event, this donation is not tax-deductible. All proceeds will go
towards our [scholarship programme](https://2019.cssconf.eu/scholarships/)
covering conference tickets as well as flights and hotel costs.

It is a privilege for us to be able to run this event, and we‚Äôd love to thank
every single one of you for your generous donations!

In this art project we tried to highlight some of the women pioneers of the
computing age. From Ada Lovelace to Margaret Hamilton, from Elizabeth Holberton
to Sophie Wilson, we showcase the lives of the women that invited compilers,
assembly languages, graphic adventure games, or changed distributed systems
research forever. 

In this talk we wanted to share with you the behind the scenes of this art
project, from motivation, to how each portrait was created. We'll also share
some hurdles we found along the way, related to scarce or spurious information
we found online.

### Wifi
We understand Wifi and internet access are important if you are in a new place
with a lot of strangers, so we‚Äôve equipped our venue with all modern 5GHz Wifi
that works. Please <a href="mailto:contact@cssconf.eu?subject=2.4GHz-Wifi">get
in touch</a> if you need access to a 2.4GHz band for legacy devices.

### Live Captioning

All talks on our two main stages are live captioned on separate screens to the
side of each stage with ample seating for anyone who needs or enjoys
subtitles.

### Childcare

We‚Äôre happy to be able to offer free, all-day childcare at the venue for
children aged 3 and above. [More details and
registration.](https://2019.cssconf.eu/news/childcare/)

### Prayer Room

We have a dedicated prayer room that attendees are welcome to use one at a
time. At the conference, talk to any staff member to access it.

### Textile Print Workshop

Instead of giving away the same t-shirt to every attendee, we decided to turn
things around and invite a local textile print service to set up shop at
CSSconf EU. We‚Äôre inviting everyone to submit print screen motives for our
attendees to print and customize their favourite garments. Making a print
screen is about 60‚Ç¨, if you want to commission one, please <a
href="mailto:contact@jsconf.eu?subject=Textile-Motives">get in touch</a>.

For attendees, bring your favourite shirts, socks, skirts and totes to get them
customised on site. There are also going to be a variety of textiles available
for purchase. Prints are for pay, cash only.

### Community Lounge

A conference inside a conference, [the Community Lounge](/community-lounge/)
runs its own separate-from-the-main-stages events to highlight technology
initiatives local to Berlin and Europe. You can find more info on the
[Community Lounge page.](/community-lounge/)

### #nailconf üíÖüèΩ

We provide a corner to paint your nails (and maybe even have some surprise
conference design ready-to-go!) by yourself or with professional help!
#nailconf was started by [@jessicard](https://twitter.com/jessicard),
[@haley](https://twitter.com/haley),
[@brittanyforks](https://twitter.com/brittanyforks),
[@jessicaspacekat](https://twitter.com/jessicaspacekat?lang=en),
[@ejgreenberg](https://www.twitter.com/ejgreenberg),
[@jlsuttles](https://twitter.com/jlsuttles?lang=en) and
[@jllord](https://www.twitter.com/jllord/) as a way to meet up, support each
other and have fun ‚Äì we think painting your nails is a great way to take a
break at the conf, chat, meet each other and celebrate fun self-expression!  

### Quiet Room

For people who need a break from the hustle and bustle of the event, we offer a
dedicated quiet area that fits about 20 people in total. This is, however, not
a quiet chamber devoid of any sensory input, and more a place to hang out and
recharge away from the main conference.

### Keeping you safe

Beyond our service team and volunteer stuff, we will of course have medical,
security and fire emergency staff standing by on-site for any eventualities.

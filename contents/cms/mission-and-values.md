CSSconf EU is a not-for-profit community conference run by a team of
volunteers. We are all active members of the tech community, and run or
contribute to various free local meetups, workshops, and education
initiatives. 

With CSSconf EU, we aim to bring the international CSS crowd together with our
beloved local Berlin community. We are humbled to look back to five sold-out
events where we welcomed the world’s most excellent CSS speakers on our stage,
and we are proud to have always put an inclusive and welcoming culture first. 

We operate under a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), run a [scholarship
program](/scholarships/), and are committed to
[accessibility](/accessibility/).

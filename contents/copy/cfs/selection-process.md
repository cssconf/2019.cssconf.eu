## Selection Process

1. All submissions are anonymized to ensure there is no bias towards the submitter.
2. All submissions are reviewed and voted for by the conference organizers and additional invited CSS experts and community members. Each talk is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, taking into account the following criteria:
  * relevance of the topic to the CSS community
  * coherence and clarity of the proposal
  * novelty/originality of the topic
  * brevity: the topic can be reasonably covered in the allocated time
3. The top submissions are then de-anonymized so that we can take speaker details into consideration. We wrote about this and further considerations that go into our curation and selection process [here](http://blog.cssconf.eu/2015/08/15/a-talk-selection-process-explained/).

We receive a lot more excellent submissions than we have speaking slots. This process has been refined over the years, and has helped us successfully select the best proposals, while hacking our own unavoidable biases.

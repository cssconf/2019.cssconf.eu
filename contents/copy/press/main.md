## About CSSconf EU

CSSconf EU is a not-for-profit community conference run by a team of [volunteers](/team/) focusing on CSS, Frontend Development, Design and UI/UX topics. We are all active members of the tech community, and run or contribute to various free local meetups, workshops, and education initiatives. With CSSconf EU, we aim to bring the international CSS crowd together with our beloved local Berlin community, through a selection of top-notch speakers from all over the world, a community lounge program showcasing local open source projects and a huge [scholarship program](/scholarships/) for people from underrepresented groups in tech who could otherwise not attend.

On **May 31st 2019**, CSSconf EU will take place in Berlin, Germany for the 7th time. In 2018, we've reached a new all-time attendee high with over 600 people from all over the world. As in the last two years, CSSconf EU and its partner event [JSConf EU](https://2019.jsconf.eu/) are taking place in the Arena, this year with even more added highlights under the name of ["Festival X"](https://2019.jsconf.eu/x/).

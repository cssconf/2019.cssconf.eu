The [**FINAL** sale of regular tickets](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2018/)
is happening [Thursday, April 5th, at 10:00 and 18:00
CET](https://ti.to/jsconfeu/jsconf-eu-2018/). If you're planning to attend the
conference, this will be your last chance to grab a ticket at the regular
price. Late tickets at a higher price might be released, but we cannot
guarantee it at this point. It will depend on sponsor demand and things like
the fire marshal determining the final allowed attendee count given the venue
configuration. So, better get in on this sale :)

Check out the [speakers](/speakers/) we announced so far. More are being
announced on a daily basis! If you or your boss needs some convincing for why
you should be at the event, [we have a page for that as well :)](/why/).

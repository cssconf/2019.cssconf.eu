Design Systems are our current model of making sense of the intersection of
front-end code and design. With the tools we have today, what is our working
model of a component? How do we define them, create them, and ensure they work
at scale? In this talk weâ€™ll discuss how our tools affect our understanding,
create a checklist of factors that make a component a component, and how to
implement the theory of components with the tools you have at hand.

In order to build our beautifully designed apps with sophisticated
interactions, we leverage the latest features in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
available in our modern evergreen browsers. However, when web development was
in its infancy two decades ago, things were drastically different. Sites had
hit counters, used frames for navigation, and were updated manually via FTP. We
used the blink tag and scrolling marquees! Let’s walk down memory lane (or have
a history lesson) and have some laughs cringing at how sites looked, how they
were built, and the rudimentary tooling we had to develop them.

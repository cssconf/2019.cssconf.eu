Flexbox, Grid and Box Alignment are the cornerstones of modern CSS layouts.
They introduce behaviours that might seem confusing if you don't completely
understand how the browser inteprets the CSS values you assign, e.g. sizing
with Flexbox, or the various options for sizing tracks in Grid. This talk will
explain a variety of modern CSS layout techniques through live demonstrations
via DevTools, and provide real-world use cases of how such techniques allow
designs to better adapt across a broad range of viewports.

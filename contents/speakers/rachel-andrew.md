We have had Grid Layout in browsers for two years. Long enough for us to start
to find the edges, and discover things we really wish it could do. The biggest
missing feature from Level 1 was subgrid, which has become the main feature for
Level 2 of the specification. In this talk I'll introduce subgrid, with use
cases, example code and some thoughts on where we might see Grid going in the
future.

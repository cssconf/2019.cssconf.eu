The debate surrounding functional CSS has some ready to dive in and others
adamant that it introduces new and undesirable patterns into our code bases. In
this talk we'll take a deep dive into the world of functional CSS and compare
it to other OOCSS methodologies. We'll explore the history of functional CSS
and where it came from, and debunk or support the various critiques of this
approach. We'll refactor an application from a more classic CSS model to one
that leverages the library tachyons.io and do some rapid prototyping in the
browser with it.

CSS Houdini is coming! With it, we gain a new set of design and development
arcane arts to leverage in superpowering our design systems! Best of all, we
can start using many of Houdiniâ€™s powers today!

This talk will focus on a handful of key browser specifications being developed
under the CSS Houdini Task Force umbrella, with key interest given to features
that can start to be leveraged today in design systems. We will cover briefly
what CSS Houdini is and describe these key technologies in relation to common
design system problems and patterns, and how Houdini can greatly improve the
flexibility, power, performance, and maintainability of these patterns.

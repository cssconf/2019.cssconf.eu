Variable fonts are a transformative evolution of type design that has huge
performance and design implications for the web. When coupled with CSS custom
properties and calculations, they make for a completely new way to think about
typography and UX. This talk will show how these technologies and techniques
can be combined in a unique way to enable dynamic, fluidly scaling typography
that reacts to screen size and other aspects of user context. It's a perfect
complement for better design systems and accessibility, too.

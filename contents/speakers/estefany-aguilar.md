For many of us, when navigating the web, we only ever encounter elements of the
web to be left-aligned. But actually, they are start-aligned! In right-to-left
languages like Hebrew, Arabic or Persian, the same settings are right-aligned.
That is the beauty of the web: It allows us to deliver our content to both
writing directions. That is why structuring our CSS layouts in a logical way
rather than with physical direction way can help us to write code that works
across languages. 
This talk will explain how CSS logical properties make that even easier.

In my quest to find out why we call tags "tags" I learned about mathematician
Emil Post (1897-1954), complexity theory, the children's game of "tag", the DOM
as a tree & why we call them CSS "rules" (it has to do with cellular automata!)
In this talk we'll walk through the many rabbit holes I went down trying to
answer this question & learn just how tied the modern browser is to fundamental
computer science.
